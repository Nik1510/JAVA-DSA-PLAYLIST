    The "this" keyword in Java is used for several important reasons:

            To Refer to the Current Object: this is a reference to the current object, the one that is being manipulated or whose constructor or method is being invoked.
            To Access Class Attributes: Itâ€™s used to access the class attributes (variables) when they are shadowed by method or constructor parameters.
            To Invoke Class Methods: Similar to accessing attributes, this can be used to call other methods of the class.
            To Use as a Constructor Call: You can use this to call one constructor from another within the same class.
