        /*
        The Arrays.toString() method in Java is used to return a string representation of the contents of the specified array12.
         Here’s how it works:

The string representation consists of a list of the array’s elements,
 enclosed in square brackets [].
Adjacent elements are separated by the characters ,
 (a comma followed by a space).

It returns null if the passed array is null1.
This method is overloaded to work with arrays of different data types,
including boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, and short12.
Here’s an example of its usage:

Java

import java.util.Arrays;

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println("String of int Array: " + Arrays.toString(intArray));
    }
}
In this example,
 the Arrays.toString() method is used to convert the intArray to a string,
  which is then printed to the console. The output would be: [1, 2, 3, 4].
